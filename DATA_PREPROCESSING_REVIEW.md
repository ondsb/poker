# Data Preprocessing Review

## Current State Summary

### ✅ What's Working Correctly

1. **Complete Cards Information**: The optimized preprocessing (`src/data/preprocess_optimized.py`) correctly extracts and includes:
   - **All players' hole cards**: `player_0_hole_card1/2` through `player_8_hole_card1/2` (supports up to 9 players)
   - **Board cards**: `board_card1` through `board_card5` (flop, turn, river)
   - **Current player's hole cards**: `hole_card1`, `hole_card2`

2. **Data Structure**: 49 features total including:
   - **Card features** (categorical): 25 features (all hole cards + board cards)
   - **Hand strength features** (numeric): 6 features (high, low, suited, paired, gap, has_cards)
   - **Game context features** (numeric): 18 features (seat_count, pot, actions, etc.)

3. **Efficient Processing**: 
   - Chunked processing to handle 27GB dataset
   - Memory-efficient with garbage collection
   - Parallel processing support

4. **Model Compatibility**: 
   - CatBoost handles categorical features natively
   - Training script (`src/models/train_model_optimized.py`) properly identifies categorical features
   - App expects correct model file names

### 🔧 Recent Fixes Applied

1. **Model Naming Consistency**: Updated training script to save models with standard names:
   - `catboost_poker_model.cbm` (instead of `catboost_poker_model_optimized.cbm`)
   - `model_metadata.pkl` (instead of `model_metadata_optimized.pkl`)

2. **Makefile Updates**: Updated `train-model` target to use optimized training script with correct data pattern

### 📊 Current Data Quality

From examining chunk_1277.parquet:
- **Shape**: 10,000 rows × 49 columns
- **Target distribution**: 85.76% non-winners, 14.24% winners (reasonable imbalance)
- **Data types**: Proper categorical (object) for cards, numeric for features
- **Missing values**: Handled gracefully with "unknown" for cards

### 🎯 Key Features Maintained

1. **All Players' Hole Cards**: The model input includes every player's hole cards, not just the current player
2. **Board Cards**: Complete board state (flop, turn, river)
3. **Game Context**: Seat count, pot size, betting actions, position
4. **Hand Strength**: Calculated features for current player's hand

### 🚀 Pipeline Status

**Current Working Pipeline:**
```
Raw Data (27GB) → preprocess_optimized.py → Chunked Parquet Files → train_model_optimized.py → CatBoost Model → Streamlit App
```

**Available Commands:**
- `make preprocess-optimized` - Process full dataset
- `make train-optimized` - Train on all chunks
- `make train-optimized-quick` - Train on subset (10 chunks)
- `make run-app` - Run Streamlit app

### ✅ Verification Points

1. **Cards Information**: ✅ All players' hole cards included
2. **Data Quality**: ✅ Proper categorical encoding, no data loss
3. **Model Compatibility**: ✅ CatBoost handles categorical features
4. **App Integration**: ✅ Correct file naming and feature expectations
5. **Scalability**: ✅ Chunked processing for large datasets

### 🎯 Recommendations

1. **Continue with current approach**: The optimized preprocessing correctly maintains all cards information
2. **Use existing pipeline**: The current setup is production-ready
3. **Monitor performance**: The chunked approach allows processing the full 27GB dataset efficiently

### 📝 Technical Details

**Feature Extraction Logic:**
- Hole cards extracted from "d dh pX YYYY" actions
- Board cards extracted from "d db YYYY" actions  
- Hand strength calculated from parsed cards
- Game context from table metadata

**Categorical Features:**
- All card features (hole cards, board cards)
- Player ID (if needed)

**Numeric Features:**
- Hand strength indicators
- Game context (pot, actions, position)
- Player statistics

The current preprocessing approach successfully maintains the requirement of having all cards information available in model inputs while providing an efficient, scalable solution for the large dataset.
