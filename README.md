# Poker Win Probability Predictor

An AI-powered poker win probability predictor using CatBoost machine learning model trained on real poker hand data.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Predictions**: Uses a CatBoost model trained on ~30k real poker hands
- **Complete Game Context**: Considers all players' hole cards, board cards, and game context
- **Multi-Player Support**: Handles 2-6 player scenarios
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant win probability calculations with visual charts
- **Random Hand Generation**: Generate random poker scenarios for testing and learning
- **Model Validation**: Comprehensive validation with predefined scenarios

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Train the model** (if not already trained):
   ```bash
   make train
   ```

3. **Run the web app**:
   ```bash
   make app
   ```

4. **Validate the model**:
   ```bash
   python validate_model_predictions.py
   ```

## Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: ~99.87%
- **ROC AUC**: ~99.95%
- **Training Data**: ~30,000 poker hands
- **Features**: 67 features including hole cards, board cards, and game context

## App Features

### Manual Input Mode
- Set number of players (2-6)
- Input all players' hole cards
- Set board cards (flop, turn, river)
- Configure game context (pot size, bets, etc.)

### Random Hand Generation
- Click "ðŸŽ² Generate Random Hand" to create random scenarios
- Perfect for testing different situations
- Ensures no duplicate cards across players and board

### Analysis Output
- Win probabilities for all players
- Visual bar charts
- Hand rankings
- Detailed analysis

## Model Validation

The validation script (`validate_model_predictions.py`) tests the model with predefined scenarios:

1. **Pocket Aces vs Low Cards**: AA vs 72o
2. **Pocket Kings vs Queens**: KK vs QQ  
3. **Flush Draw vs High Cards**: Flush draw on flush-heavy board
4. **Set vs Overpair**: 777 vs AA
5. **Straight vs Two Pair**: Made straight vs high cards
6. **Three Players**: AA vs KK vs 72o
7. **River Decision**: Made straight vs flush draw
