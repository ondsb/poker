## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion

The key insight is that **data quality and feature engineering** will provide the biggest improvements. The known cards model achieved 100% AUC because it had complete information. By improving data quality and adding sophisticated features (especially equity calculations and player modeling), we can dramatically improve the ensemble model without overcomplicating the architecture.

**Target**: Achieve >95% AUC through focused improvements in data and features rather than complex model architectures.
